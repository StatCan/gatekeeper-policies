# GateKeeper Policies

Policies that are to be enforced by [GateKeeper](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper) for the Kubernetes Platform.

> Note: Gatekeeper is a validating / mutating webhook that enforces CRD-based policies executed by the Open Policy Agent.

## Policies

### General

This repo contains general policies that can be used to enforce common Kubernetes requirements.

### Service Mesh

This repo contains a set of common policies that can be used to enforce specific Service Mesh features.

| Control Aspect      | Gatekeeper Constraint Template                          |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |

| Traffic Policy      | [traffic-policy](service-mesh/traffic-policy)           |

## Testing

When creating a Policy, there are currently three ways of testing them:

### OPA Tests

The `opa` CLI can be used to run [tests](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-testing) on policies.
This can be very useful since Open Policy Agent allows for easy mocking of data via the [`with` keyword](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-testing/#data-and-function-mocking).

> These types of tests are best suited for policies which require access to data not available in the [`AdmissionReview`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/#webhook-request-and-response) API but accessed via [Gatekeeper's data replication features](https://open-policy-agent.github.io/gatekeeper/website/docs/sync).

To take advantage of automatic test running and the automatic copying of `rego` into a  `ConstraintTemplate`, the following structure needs to be followed:
- Ensure that the `ConstraintTemplate` is in a file named `template.yaml` at the root of your policy's folder
- Ensure that the `rego` files are in a folder called `rego`
  - For example: [general/restrict-hostnames/rego](./general/restrict-hostnames/rego/)
- Ensure that the `rego` that should be injected into the `ConstraintTemplate` is named `src.rego`
- Run the [`rego.sh`](./rego.sh) script to run tests and copy your source code into `template.yaml`
  - Note: requires the [`yq`](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq) utility

### Integration Tests

Integration tests are run as part of the GitHub Actions. These deploy policies to a `k3s` cluster using the [BATS](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) framework. It deploys the `ConstraintTemplate` for the policy, a single CustomResource of the CRD derived from the `ConstraintTemplate`, and two resources representing a passing and a failing scenario.

To take advantage of this system create the following:
- Ensure that the `ConstraintTemplate` is in a file named `template.yaml` at the root of your policy's folder
- Create a folder names `example` at the root of your policy's folder
- In the `example` folder:
  - Create a file named `constraint.yaml` with the `CustomResource` representing an implemented policy
  - Create a file named `allowed.yaml` with a resource that should pass the policy
  - Create a file named `disallowed.yaml` with a resource that should not pass the policy
