kind: Kustomization

# Each entry in this list should resolve to a directory
# containing a kustomization file, else the
# customization fails.
#
# The entry could be a relative path pointing to a local directory
# or a url pointing to a directory in a remote repo.
# The url should follow hashicorp/go-getter URL format
# https://github.com/hashicorp/go-getter#url-format
#
# The presence of this field means this file (the file
# you a reading) is an _overlay_ that further
# customizes information coming from these _bases_.
#
# Typical use case: a dev, staging and production
# environment that are mostly identical but differing
# crucial ways (image tags, a few server arguments,
# etc. that differ from the common base).
bases:
- general
- pod-security-policy
- service-mesh

# Each entry in this list must resolve to an existing
# resource definition in YAML.  These are the resource
# files that kustomize reads, modifies and emits as a
# YAML string, with resources separated by document
# markers ("---").
# resources:
#   - gatekeeper-opa-sync.yaml
