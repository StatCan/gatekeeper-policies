## Employee-Only Features Policy

Applies to Pod and Notebook objects

Checks `state.aaw.statcan.gc.ca/non-employee-users` label in Profile and the container image to allow/deny Pod and Notebook objects to be created

### Label Set in Pod and Notebook

`state.aaw.statcan.gc.ca/non-employee-users: "true"` and SAS image --> deny

`state.aaw.statcan.gc.ca/non-employee-users: "true"` and non-SAS image --> allow

`state.aaw.statcan.gc.ca/non-employee-users: "false"`Â´ --> allow 

If the label is not set in the Profile, the fallthrough/default is to allow.

### SAS Images

If the container image starts with `k8scc01covidacr.azurecr.io/sas:`, it is considered a SAS image and the label in the Profile will have to be set to `false` to create the Pod and Notebook objects.
